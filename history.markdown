I originally started developing Coherent back in 2005 because I wanted to use Cocoa for my Web applications, but Cocoa was only available for Mac applications. If there had been a Web version of Cocoa, I never would have begun developing Coherent.

After I joined Apple in the Spring of 2007, I felt that development of Coherent could best be served were it resting in Apple's hands. So in June of 2008, I transferred ownership of the Coherent source code version 1.0 to Apple, Inc. Working with the development team from Dashcode, we quickly revised and improved the library ultimately ending up with the code that formed the foundation of the Dashcode Javascript library.

Unfortunately, I didn't succeed in my goal of getting Apple to release Coherent under an open source license. And when I moved back to Seattle (long story), I really wanted to resurrect Coherent. Fortunately, the license for the source code generated by Dashcode is incredibly generous and I was able to reconstitute Coherent and make some much needed bug fixes and improvements.

Iâ€™m delighted to announce a beta version of the Coherent library version 3.0 is now available via [GitHub](http://github.com/jeffwatkins/coherent/). I anticipate a final release of version 3.0 around January 2011.
